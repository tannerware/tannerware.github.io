            <p> A goodbye: AXIAL is no longer maintened by Jason[Veridian] and is now being owned/maintened by Austin[Zdrada].<br>
                Jason will be saying his goodbyes to the scripting/ahk scene in a thread coming to V3rmillion soon.<br>
                I [Austin] hope to take this project further and improve on Jason's current work beyond what he could possibly do.<br>
            As for AXIAL; it will be recieving yet another overhall back to the GUI version.
            Jason is a great friend of mine, as for his reason for leaving; I don't feel right saying it here. I'm sure he'll cover it in his V3rm thread.
            This website will also be recieving an overhall. That's all for now, contact my business Discord for any reason necessary.</p><br>
