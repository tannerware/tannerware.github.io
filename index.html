                My brother Tanner was a bright individual who exceeded in computing, and was loved dearly by his family. He was on his computer from day till night and loved talking with his friends and playing video games. He had a passion for programming and soccer. His family misses him dearly, and he shall never be forgotten. Rest in piece Tanner, 2001-2019.

                My goal
            </h1>
            <p>This website is ran by his brother Ryan. My goal is to recovery my brothers work from his PC which he kindly gave to me before his passing. I'm constantly trying to find more of his work but his PC is not organised at all, there seems to be tons upon tons of just empty folders with just gibberish names. DBAs file name on his computer was named "workrrkre1". No clue what that means and there was about 10 copies of it.</p>

            </h1>
            <p>.Currently the only project i have found is this Discord Bot Automater, it works fine but i'm not really sure what the whole Idle Miner thing is or why it spams commands like l.sell, l.hunt etc.</p>
