            <p> A goodbye: AXIAL is no longer maintened by Jason[Veridian] and is now being owned/maintened by Austin[Zdrada].<br>
                Jason will be saying his goodbyes to the scripting/ahk scene in a thread coming to V3rmillion soon.<br>
                I [Austin] hope to take this project further and improve on Jason's work further.</p>
